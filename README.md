# Node.js Task Queuing with Rate Limiting

This project is a Node.js API that manages task queuing and rate limiting for user requests. Each user is limited to 1 task per second and 20 tasks per minute, with tasks queued if the rate limit is exceeded.




## Run Locally

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  node app.js
```


## Usage
***Start the Server:***

After running "node app.js", the server will start with two workers listening on localhost:3000.

***Test the API:***

Send a POST request to http://localhost:3000/task with

***JSON body:***

{
    "user_id": "123"
}

Used "Postman" for testing
## Tech Stack

**Node.js:** Backend API and server logic

**Express:** HTTP server and routing

**Redis:** Task queueing and rate limit management

**Cluster:** Multi-process setup for load balancing

## Approach

***Rate Limiting*** The application uses Redis to track task counts per user per second and per
minute.

***Task Queueing:*** If a user exceeds the rate limit, tasks are queued in memory and executed when
within limits.

***Logging:*** Each completed task logs the user ID and timestamp in task_log.txt.

***Clustering:*** The application uses Nodeâ€™s cluster module to spawn two workers, enhancing performance and reliability

## Assumption

Each user has a unique user_id, used for tracking rate limits.

Redis is configured to run on localhost:6379.

Rate limits apply independently per user.
